#any(): This expression returns True if any element of the iterable is true. If the iterable is empty, it will return False.
#all(): This expression returns True if all of the elements of the iterable are true. If the iterable is empty, it will return True.

#:: means [start:stop:step] slicing tool eg: [::2] means Start at the beginning, go to the end, take every 2nd element. 'Hello'[::2] results in 'Hlo' [::-1] means Start at the beginning, go to the end, take steps of -1 (reversing the sequence). eg: 'World'[::-1] results in 'dlroW'
