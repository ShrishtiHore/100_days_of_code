#The defaultdict tool is a container in the collections class of Python. It's similar to the usual dictionary (dict) container, but the only difference is that a defaultdict will have a default value if that key has not been set yet. If you didn't use a defaultdict you'd have to check to see if that key exists, and if it doesn't, set it to what you want.

from collections import defaultdict
import sys

try:
    N, M = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
except:
    N, M = 0, 0 
    
group_a = defaultdict(list) 
for i in range(N):
    word = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    
    group_a[word].append(str(i + 1))
    
for _ in range(M):
    # Read the next M lines for Group B
    word = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    
    if word in group_a:
        print(' '.join(group_a[word]))
    else:
        print('-1')
