#The eval() expression is a very powerful built-in function of Python. It helps in evaluating an expression. The expression can be a Python statement, or a code object.

#example the polynomial problem to check if value of k is equal to sum of the powers of the polynomials

#or simple examples like eval("9 + 5") gives automatically 14

#or type(eval("len")) for code functions like this

eval(input()) #simple and satheek!
