How it works (Simple Terms):
1. Start with the first number.
2. For each next number, check if it's different from the last unique number found.
3. If it's different, that means it's a new unique number, so move it forward in the list.
4. At the end, nums[:unique+1] contains all unique numbers at the front of the list.
5. Return the count unique + 1 (the number of unique numbers).
